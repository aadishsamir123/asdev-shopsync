# Implementation Plan: Folder Organization for ShopSync

## Overview

This plan outlines the implementation of a folder-based organization system for shopping lists in the ShopSync app. The current system displays all lists in a flat structure on the home screen. The new system will introduce folders to help users categorize and organize their shopping lists for better management and navigation.

## Requirements

### Core Requirements

1. **Folder Creation and Management**: Users can create, rename, and delete folders
2. **List Organization**: Users can move lists into folders and reorganize them as needed
3. **Nested Folder Structure**: Support for subfolders (up to 3 levels deep) for advanced organization
4. **Folder Sharing**: Ability to share entire folders with other users
5. **Smart Folders**: Auto-categorization based on list names, store locations, or creation patterns

### Technical Requirements

1. Update Firestore data structure to support folder hierarchy
2. Implement folder management operations
3. Create intuitive folder navigation UI
4. Add drag-and-drop functionality for list organization
5. Implement folder-based filtering and search

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Data Structure Updates

#### 1.1 Update Firestore Schema

**File**: `lib/services/firestore_service.dart`

- Add folders collection structure:

```json
{
    'id': 'folderId',
    'name': 'Grocery Shopping',
    'description': 'Weekly grocery runs',
    'createdBy': 'userId',
    'createdAt': Timestamp,
    'updatedAt': Timestamp,
    'parentFolderId': 'parentId', // null for root folders
    'color': '#4CAF50', // Optional folder color
    'icon': 'folder', // Optional folder icon
    'members': {
        'userId1': {'role': 'editor', 'joinedAt': Timestamp},
        'userId2': {'role': 'viewer', 'joinedAt': Timestamp}
    },
    'isShared': false,
    'listCount': 5, // Cached count for performance
    'path': ['parentId1', 'parentId2'], // Full path for nested folders
    'position': 0 // For custom ordering
}
```

UPDATED LISTS COLLECTION:
```json
{
// ... existing fields
'folderId': 'folderId', // null for lists in root
'position': 0 // Position within folder
}
```

#### 1.2 Create Folder Constants

**File**: `lib/constants/folder_constants.dart` (new file)

DART CODE FOR FOLDER CONSTANTS:

    static const String rootFolderId = 'root';

    static const List<String> defaultFolderIcons = [
        'folder',
        'shopping_cart',
        'home',
        'work',
        'family',
        'vacation'
    ];

    static const List<String> defaultFolderColors = [
        '#4CAF50', '#2196F3', '#FF9800',
